## Contributing to Talketeer

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Talketeer!

Talketeer is a **feature-complete, production-grade real-time chat application**
originally designed and implemented by the project maintainer.

During **SWoC 2026**, contributions are **strictly review-gated and scope-limited**
to preserve stability, maintainability, and learning integrity.

Please read this document carefully before opening an issue or pull request.

## Maintainer Authority

This repository is **maintainer-led**.

- The project maintainer is the **final authority** on scope, design, and acceptance
- All contributions are reviewed at the maintainer’s discretion
- The maintainer may close issues or pull requests without review or explanation
if they violate these guidelines

Participation in SWoC **does not override** repository rules.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + TypeScript, React Query, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Socket.IO-client
- Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Socket.IO
- Database: MongoDB (Mongoose)
- Authentication: JWT (Access tokens and Refresh tokens), Google OAuth2

## 🚫 AI-Generated Code Policy (Strict)

**Any form of AI-generated code is strictly prohibited.**

This includes (but is not limited to):
- Code generated by ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude, etc.
- AI-assisted refactors or implementations
- AI-generated test code
- AI-generated configuration or scripts

### ✅ Only Exception
- **Documentation files** (.md) may use AI assistance
- **Code comments are NOT documentation** and **are not exempt**

If AI-generated code is detected:

- The PR will be **closed immediately**
- Repeated violations may result in a **permanent contribution ban**

This rule exists to preserve **authentic learning**, which is a core goal of SWoC.

## What Contributions Are Accepted

### ✅ Accepted
- Documentation improvements (.md files only)
- Bug fixes with clear reproduction steps
- Refactors that **do not change behavior**
- Test additions or improvements
- Minor UI/UX polish (no redesigns)
- Small, well-scoped features **only if explicitly approved by the maintainer**

### ❌ Not Accepted
- AI-generated or AI-assisted code (see policy above)
- Major new features or feature expansions
- Architectural changes
- Tech stack migrations
- Performance rewrites
- Large refactors without prior discussion
- Unapproved feature implementations
- Non-code or non-document changes
    - (e.g. directory restructuring, renaming folders, repo reorganization)
- Cosmetic-only changes with no functional or documentation value
- “Please assign me this issue” or entitlement-style requests

**Pull requests outside the accepted scope may be closed without review.**

## Before You Start

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Comment on the issue you want to work on
3. **Wait for explicit confirmation from the maintainer**
4. Start work **only after approval**

Unapproved pull requests increase review overhead and may be closed immediately.

## Branching & Commits

- `main` is the stable, production branch
- `dev` is the active development branch

All contributions must:
- Create a new branch from `dev`
- Open pull requests **only against** `dev`
- Keep PRs minimal and focused
- Address **one logical change per PR**

Pull requests opened against `main` will be closed without review.

## Commit Messages
There is no strict commit message format.

However:
- Commit messages must clearly describe what changed
- Vague messages like `fix stuff`, `update`, or `changes` are discouraged

Clear intent > rigid format.

## Pull Request Guidelines
Your PR must:

- Clearly explain **what** changed and **why**
- Reference the relevant issue (if applicable)
- Avoid unrelated formatting or cleanup
- Follow existing code patterns

The maintainer may request changes, ask for clarification, or close the PR if it
does not align with project goals or SWoC expectations.

## Code Style & Philosophy

- Follow existing patterns — do not introduce new styles
- Prefer readability and explicitness
- Avoid clever hacks or premature optimization
- Stability > novelty

## Final Note

Talketeer is **not a sandbox project**.

It prioritizes:
- Code quality
- Stability
- Maintainability
- Honest learning

If you respect these principles, your contributions are welcome.
If not, this repository may not be a good fit.

Thank you for contributing responsibly.
