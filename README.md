# 🗨️ Talketeer
**Talketeer** is a full-stack, real-time chat application built with the **MERN** stack and **Socket.io**.  
It delivers an intuitive chatting experience with real-time messaging, room creation, typing indicators, and message persistence — all wrapped in a modern and responsive interface.

> 💬 The design takes _some_ inspiration from [Discord](https://github.com/discord), because I use it a lot!
