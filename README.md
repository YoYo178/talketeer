# 🗨️ Talketeer

**Talketeer** is a full‑stack, real‑time chat application built with the **MERN stack** and **Socket.IO**. It delivers a fast, intuitive chatting experience with room‑based conversations, typing indicators, and persistent message history — all wrapped in a clean, modern, and responsive interface.

> 💬 **Design note:** The UI takes inspiration from **Discord** (because I use it a lot!), focusing on clarity, speed, and usability.
